# Intent Recognition with BERT using Huggingface and Pytorch




Recognizing intent (IR) from text is very useful these days. Usually, you get a short text (sentence or two) and have to classify it into one (or multiple) categories.

Multiple product support systems (help centers) use IR to reduce the need for a large number of employees that copy-and-paste boring responses to frequently asked questions. Chatbots, automated email responders, answer recommenders (from a knowledge base with questions and answers) strive to not let you take the time of a real person.

**Text is trained of these seven different categories: ['AddToPlaylist' 'BookRestaurant' 'GetWeather' 'PlayMusic' 'RateBook'
 'SearchCreativeWork' 'SearchScreeningEvent']**
 
 ## Sample output
 
 ## Text - Play our song now,  Output - PlayMusic
 
 
 ## Text - Rate this book as awful, Output - RateBook
